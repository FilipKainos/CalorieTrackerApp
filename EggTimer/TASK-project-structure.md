# Project Structure & Setup

## Purpose
Define the folder structure, file naming conventions, and initial setup for the EggTimer project.

## Tasks
- Decide on tech stack (HTML/CSS/JS, React, etc.)
- Create folders for `src/`, `assets/`, `docs/`, etc.
- Set up version control (e.g., .gitignore)
- Add a basic README.md
- Set up any build tools or linters if needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, documented folder structure
- All team members (and AI Copilot) can find and add files easily
- Project is ready for feature development
